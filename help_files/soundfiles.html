    <h1>Sound Files</h1>

    <p>The sound card identifies the function of each sound by its file name, so you must name your files exactly as shown in the tables below. 
    Not every sound is required: if there is some sound you don't want to play, just omit it from the SD card and it will be ignored. 
    </p>

    </p>
    Sound files must be saved as <b>16 bit 44,100 Hz WAV files</b>. It doesn't matter if the files are in mono or stereo format, but since the card can only drive a 
    single speaker any stereo files will be output as mono. 
    </p>
