<h3>INI Creator Help</h3>

<p>
    This program is the INI Creator Utility for the Open Panzer Sound Card. The utility lets you save an INI file of all your settings. This INI file must then 
    be placed on the SD memory card along with your sound files in WAV format, and inserted into your physical sound card.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> This utility is only needed when using your sound card in RC input mode, meaning, you intend to control it directly from a 
    standard hobby receiver. If on the other hand you are using the sound card with the Open Panzer TCB (Tank Control Board), then all configuratation
    is performed by the TCB, and you <i><b>do not need</b></i> this utility at all. For more information on how to use the sound card with the TCB, 
    see the <a href="http://openpanzer.org/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:tcb:tcbinstall:sound_op_v2">Open Panzer Wiki</a>.
