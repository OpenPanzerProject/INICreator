	<h1>Firmware</h1>
	
	<h2 id="flash">Update Firmware</h2>
	<p>
	On this tab you can update the sound card firmware if necessary. Firmware comes in a Hex file and you can download the latest release or use your own hex file. 
	</p>
	
	<h4	class="entry">Get Latest Release</h4>
	<p>
	Click here to check the OpenPanzer.org website for the latest firmware for your sound card. If a file is detected the version number will be displayed and the hex file will be 
	downloaded to a temporary folder. 
	</p>
	
	<h4	class="entry">Use Your Own Hex</h4>
	<p>
	If you are a developer and have compiled your own hex, or perhaps were given a testing Hex by a developer on the Open Panzer forums, you can select it using this button. If you are working 
    on a project in the Arduino IDE, you can generate a hex file by typing Ctrl+Alt+S or going to the Sketch menu and selecting the "Export compiled Binary" option. The hex file will then appear 
    in your sketch folder (instructions valid for Arduino 1.6.5, and may change with future versions). 
	</p>
	
	<h4	class="entry">Flash</h4>
	<p>
	Connect your Sound Card to your computer using a standard USB cable. A new entry may or may not appear in the COM ports list but in this case it doesn't matter 
    that you select a COM port, the flash process will detect your sound card automatically. Once you have selected a hex file, either the latest release you downloaded or one of your own, 
    click the Flash button to start the process - but then you must also <u>press the small button on the top of the Sound Card</u> for the process to complete. You may hear the USB 
    connect/disconnect sounds from your computer during this process, that is normal. The status of the flash operation will be shown in the console window. If you forget to press the 
    button or the program can't find your device, the flash operation will time out after 10 seconds. 
    </p>
	
    
		
	<h2 id="console">Console Utility</h2>
	<p>
	The built-in console is a useful debugging tool. It is basically a window to whichever COM port you have selected, and if you are in "Snooping" mode, any information received on 
	that COM port will be printed in the console window.
    </p>

	<h4	class="entry">Snoop</h4>
	<p>
	When you click the Snoop button, the selected COM port will be opened at the specified baud rate. Click the button a second time to stop snooping. 
	</p>
	
	<h4	class="entry">Clear Screen</h4>
	<p>
	This will empty all prior contents from the console screen. 
	</p>
	
	<h4	class="entry">Autoscroll</h4>
	<p>
	If checked, the console window will maintain focus on the most recent line of data to arrive. 
	</p>
