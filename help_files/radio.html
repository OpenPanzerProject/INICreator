	<h1>Radio Settings</h1>
	
	<p>
    The sound card can read up to 5 RC inputs. It accepts standard PWM signals ranging from 1000 to 2000 mS, with 1500 mS considered "center." (Remember, if you are using the sound card with 
    the Open Panzer TCB then the RC inputs will not be used at all and you don't need this program.) On the Radio tab you define the function of the sound card that each of these 5 channels will 
    control. Let's go through all the possible settings:
    </p>
    
	
	<h4 class="entry">Channel Type</h4>
	<p>
	Each channel must be assigned a "type." The most common type is "Switch" which simply means this channel represents a physical switch on your transmitter. You may choose to have all 5 channels 
    be of the Switch type, and below we will discuss how you specify how many positions your switch has and what function should be performed in each position.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Two other special types exist, "Engine Speed" and "Volume." These are optional, but if chosen Engine Speed will always be assigned to channel 1, and Volume will always be assigned to channel 5. 
    If you are using the sound card in a model vehicle you will most likely want to implement the Engine Speed type, connected to the throttle channel of your RC receiver. The sound card will monitor
    this channel and play the various engine sounds appropriate to the speed of your model (see the <a href="soundfiles.html">Sound Files Reference</a> for more details on these sounds). If you choose
    to use the Engine Speed channel type further settings related to the throttle channel can be made on the <a href="settings.html#engine">Settings tab</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The Volume channel type allows you to control the master volume of the sound card from your transmitter, ideally from a potentiometer/knob but you could use a switch with it as well. 
    </p>
    

	<h4 class="entry">Channel Reverse ("Rev.")</h4>
	<p>
    Check the "Rev." box next to any channel that you need to treat as reversed.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="entry">Switch Positions</h4>
	<p>
    For each channel assigned to the "Switch" type, specify here the number of positions the corresponding physical switch on your transmitter has. The sound card can handle switches with up to 6 positions.
    </p>
    
	<h4 class="entry">Switch Position Assignments</h4>
	<p>    
    For each position of each channel assigned to the "Switch" type, choose from the available options what function or action you want to occur when the switch is in that position. Not every 
    switch positions have to be assigned, and depending on what you are trying to accomplish it may make sense to leave some positions blank. 
    </p>

    See the <a href="functionlist.html">Function List</a> page for a complete description of all available functions.
